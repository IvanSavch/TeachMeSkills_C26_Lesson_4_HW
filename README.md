my homework number 4
This reposyitory was crate for my homework number 4:
0. Create an array of integers. Write a program that prints a message indicating whether the given number is included in the array or not.
1. Create an array of integers. Remove all occurrences of the given numbers from the array.
2. Create and fill an array with random numbers and print maximum, minimum and average value.
3. Create 2 arrays of 5 numbers. Print the arrays to the console on two separate lines. Calculate the arithmetic mean of the elements of each array and tell us for which of the arrays this value was greater (or report that their arithmetic means are equal).

Additional tasks
4. Create an array of n random integers and print it to the screen. Let the array size be set from the console and the array size can be greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10. If n does not satisfy the condition, print a message about this. If the user has entered an inappropriate number, then the program should ask the user to repeat the input. Create a second array from only the even elements of the first array, if they are there, and display it on the screen.
5. Create an array and populate the array. Print the array to the screen as a string. Replace each element with an odd index with zero.
6. Create an array of strings. Fill it with arbitrary names of people. Sort the array.
7. Implement a bubble sort algorithm
